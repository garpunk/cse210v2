Welcome to my tutorials!

I love learning new stuff and I look forward to making these tutorials. Honestly by creating tutorials it's a way to get that repetition needed for learning new things. I may use this to help me better learn concepts we learn in class, so you may see a few markdowns that are of concepts we learned in class. One of the reasons I like to do this is so I can have a wealth of notes that I can draw upon for future projects rather than trying to pressure myself to memorize all of the syntax and stuff.

I have my tutorials organized in folders for each project I've used new things in, just navigate to the folder within the tutorials folder to get started!
